# CodingDojo_Flask_Checkerboard
Build a flask server to practice passing information from the url to the route and using loops to iterate information from the route to the template. 
Create a static file to practice styling the template.

1. Have the index route display an 8 by 8 checkerboard.
2. Have the route /(x) display the number of rows specified in url (x) for the checkerboard. 
3. Have the route /(X)/(y) display the number of rows (x) and the number of columns (y) specified in the url for the checkerboard.
